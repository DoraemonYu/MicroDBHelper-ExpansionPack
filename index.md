# MicroDBHelper-ExpansionPack
These are Optional Expansion Packs for [MicroDBHelper](https://doraemonyu.github.io/MicroDBHelper/) , which is a friendly interface library to use SQLHelper. 
 

## Background
MicroDBHelper is also target to make a **lightweight and friendly** library, so the core Features are only Focus on Pure SqlHelper, and without **some related features** (such as Entity Conversion, Paging Query , etc.) which is useful in the development.   

In fact, for the original intention of the design, developers, who use MicroDBHelper library, can use their demand logic to simply write , or use some other libraries which is good at specific areas , to achieve those related features like Entity Conversion.  

However, in the another hand, some developers still hope I could provide some related features for MicroDBHelper. Then they can relatively smooth to learn and use MicroDBHelper library in the early. And then consider whether to replace them, the related features, in the later.
